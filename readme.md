# NG-PORTFOLIO

This is the source code for my portfolio website at https://www.versellie.com


It is a simple portfolio website created using Bootstrap and Angular.  It is a python flask app which serves the frontend  
while also providing an api endpoint to send emails via the form.

It is based on a free template which can be found here: https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer.
